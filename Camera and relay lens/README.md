# Camera and relay lens cube
This module holds the camera and the relay lens. We used a modified 2x1 UC2 cube to allow more space for adjusting distance between the two. We used FLIR ChameleonÂ®3 USB 3.0 Camera and Thorlabs MAP104040-A 1:1 Matched Achromatic Pair, f1=40.0 mm, f2=40.0 mm, ARC: 400-700 nm as relay lens. Note that the 20_Cube_Insert_RaspiCam_3.5mm_thick v3.stl was printed using Ultimaker 3.
