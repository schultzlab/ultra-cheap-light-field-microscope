# Ultra-cheap light field microscope
This is a repository for the BE3 Group Project on ultra-cheap light field microscopy under the supervision of Schultz lab at Imperial College London. It contains mainly the STL and other CAD files used to 3D print the microscope framework. We mainly used Prusa i3 MK3S printer although Ultimaker 3 was also used for a small amount of components. All parts are printed in PLA. This project was largely inspired by the  [UC2 toolbox](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT) which we shall cite here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4041339.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4041339).

This is how the system looks like in operation:
