# LED Holder Cube

This is a cube for holding for LED. We used the M490L4 490 nm, 205 mW (Min) Mounted LED, 350 mA and ACL25416U-A Aspheric Condenser Lens, Ã˜1", f=16 mm, NA=0.79, ARC: 350-700 nm from Thorlabs as the condenser. An image of the LED cube with the driver (LEDD1B T-Cube LED Driver, 1200 mA Max Drive Current, Thorlabs) and an image of the cube alone are shown below:
