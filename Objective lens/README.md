# Objective Lens Holder Cube

Objective holder for Thorlabs' RMS20X - 20X Olympus Plan Achromat Objective, 0.4 NA, 1.2 mm WD, 24.0mm in diameter. The naming convention for the objective mount is UC2_20_focus_inlet_objective_mount_v8_(screw hole diameter, 32 if absent)_(bottom internal diameter)-(top internal diameter)-(external diameter).stl. For us UC2_20_focus_inlet_objective_mount_v8_30-202-242-266 v15.stl worked with Prusa i3 MK3S but different dimensions may be needed on a different 3D printer.

There is a modified UC2 Z-Stage to move the objetive along the optical axis.
