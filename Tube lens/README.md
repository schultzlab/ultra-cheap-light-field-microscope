# Tube Lens Cube

This module holds the tube lens for the microscope. We used AC254-200-AB f = 200.0 mm, Ã˜1" Achromatic Doublet, ARC: 400 - 1100 nm from Thorlabs as the tube lens. 

Photos of the assembled module are shown below:

Note the cube in the images was printed with Ultimaker 3, but cubes printed by Prusa i3 MK3S should also work.
